# This file is the entry point of the package: it defines the new `Measurement'

##### New Type: Measurement
# Definition.  The Measurement type is composed by the following fields:
#   * val: the nominal value of the measurement
#   * err: the uncertainty, assumed to be standard deviation
#   * tag: a (hopefully) unique identifier, it is used to identify a specific
#     measurement in the list of derivatives.  NOTE: independent measurements
#     have tag > 0.  For dependent quantities the tag is 0.
#   * der: the list of derivates.  It is a lightweight dictionary, whose keys
#     are the tuples (nominal value, uncertainty, tag) of all independent
#     variables from which the object has been derived, the corresponding value
#     is the partial derivative of the object with respect to that independent
#     variable.  This dictionary is useful to trace the contribution of each
#     measurement and propagate the uncertainty in the case of functions with
#     more than one argument (in order to deal with correlation between
#     arguments).

    measurement(val::Real, [err::Real]) -> Measurement
    val ± err -> Measurement

Return a `Measurement` object with `val` as nominal value and `err` as
uncertainty.  `err` defaults to 0 if omitted.

The binary operator `±` is equivalent to `measurement`, so you can construct a
`Measurement` object by explicitely writing `123 ± 4`.
