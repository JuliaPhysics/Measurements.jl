Examples
========

These are some basic examples of use of the package:

```@repl
using Measurements
a = measurement(4.5, 0.1)
b = 3.8 ± 0.4
2a + b
a - 1.2b
l = measurement(0.936, 1e-3);
T = 1.942 ± 4e-3;
g = 4pi^2*l/T^2
c = measurement(4)
a*c
sind(94 ± 1.2)
x = 5.48 ± 0.67;
y = 9.36 ± 1.02;
log(2x^2 - 3.4y)
atan(y, x)
```

Measurements from Strings
-------------------------

You can construct `Measurement{Float64}` objects from strings. Within
parentheses there is the uncertainty referred to the corresponding last digits.

```@repl
using Measurements
measurement("-12.34(56)")
measurement("+1234(56)e-2")
measurement("123.4e-1 +- 0.056e1")
measurement("(-1.234 ± 0.056)e1")
measurement("1234e-2 +/- 0.56e0")
measurement("-1234e-2")
```

It is also possible to use `parse(Measurement{T}, string)` to parse the `string`
as a `Measurement{T}`, with `T<:AbstractFloat`. This has been tested with
standard numeric floating types (`Float16`, `Float32`, `Float64`, and
`BigFloat`).

```@repl
using Measurements
parse(Measurement{Float16}, "19.5 ± 2.8")
parse(Measurement{Float32}, "-7.6 ± 0.4")
parse(Measurement{Float64}, "4 ± 1.3")
parse(Measurement{BigFloat}, "+5.1 ± 3.3")
```

Correlation Between Variables
-----------------------------

Here you can see examples of how functionally correlated variables are treated
within the package:

```@repl
using Measurements, SpecialFunctions
x = 8.4 ± 0.7
x - x
x/x
x*x*x - x^3
sin(x)/cos(x) - tan(x) # They are equal within numerical accuracy
y = -5.9 ± 0.2;
beta(x, y) - gamma(x)*gamma(y)/gamma(x + y)
```

You will get similar results for a variable that is a function of an already
existing `Measurement` object:

```@repl
using Measurements
x = 8.4 ± 0.7;
u = 2x;
(x + x) - u
u/2x
u^3 - 8x^3
cos(x)^2 - (1 + cos(u))/2
```

A variable that has the same nominal value and uncertainty as `u` above but is
not functionally correlated with `x` will give different outcomes:

```@repl
using Measurements
x = 8.4 ± 0.7;
v = 16.8 ± 1.4;
(x + x) - v
v / 2x
v^3 - 8x^3
cos(x)^2 - (1 + cos(v))/2
```

`@uncertain` Macro
------------------

Macro [`@uncertain`](@ref) can be used to propagate uncertainty in arbitrary
real or complex functions of real arguments, including functions not natively
supported by this package.

```@repl
using Measurements, SpecialFunctions
@uncertain (x -> complex(zeta(x), exp(eta(x)^2)))(2 ± 0.13)
@uncertain log(9.4 ± 1.3, 58.8 ± 3.7)
log(9.4 ± 1.3, 58.8 ± 3.7) # Exact result
@uncertain atan(10, 13.5 ± 0.8)
atan(10, 13.5 ± 0.8) # Exact result
```

You usually do not need to define a wrapping function before using it.  In the
case where you have to define a function, like in the first line of previous
examples, [anonymous
functions](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/functions/#man-anonymous-functions-1)
allow you to do it in a very concise way.

The macro works with functions calling C/Fortran functions as well. For example,
[Cuba.jl](https://github.com/giordano/Cuba.jl) package performs numerical
integration by wrapping the C [Cuba](http://www.feynarts.de/cuba/) library. You
can define a function to numerically compute with `Cuba.jl` the integral
defining the [error function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_function) and
pass it to `@uncertain` macro. Compare the result with that of the `erf`
function, natively supported in `Measurements.jl` package

```@repl
using Measurements, Cuba, SpecialFunctions
cubaerf(x::Real) =
    2x/sqrt(pi)*cuhre((t, f) -> f[1] = exp(-abs2(t[1]*x)))[1][1]
@uncertain cubaerf(0.5 ± 0.01)
erf(0.5 ± 0.01) # Exact result
```

Also here you can use an anonymous function instead of defining the `cubaerf`
function, do it as an exercise. Remember that if you want to numerically
integrate a function that returns a `Measurement` object you can use `QuadGK.jl`
package, which is written purely in Julia and in addition allows you to set
`Measurement` objects as endpoints, see below.

!!! tip
    Note that the argument of `@uncertain` macro must be a function call.
    Thus,

    ```julia
    julia> using Measurements, SpecialFunctions

    julia> @uncertain zeta(13.4 ± 0.8) + eta(8.51 ± 0.67)
    ERROR: MethodError: no method matching zeta(::Measurement{Float64})
    [...]
    ```

    will not work because here the outermost function is `+`, whose
    arguments are `zeta(13.4 ± 0.8)` and `eta(8.51 ± 0.67)`, that however
    cannot be calculated. You can use the `@uncertain` macro on each
    function separately:

    ```jldoctest
    julia> using Measurements, SpecialFunctions

    julia> @uncertain(zeta(13.4 ± 0.8)) +  @uncertain(eta(8.51 ± 0.67))
    1.9974 ± 0.0012
    ```

    In addition, the function must be differentiable in all its arguments.
    For example, the polygamma function of order $m$, `polygamma(m, x)`, is
    the $m+1$-th derivative of the logarithm of gamma function, and is not
    differentiable in the first argument, because the first argument must be
    an integer. You can easily work around this limitation by wrapping the
    function in a single-argument function:

    ```jldoctest
    julia> using Measurements, SpecialFunctions

    julia> @uncertain (x -> polygamma(0, x))(4.8 ± 0.2)
    1.461 ± 0.046

    julia> digamma(4.8 ± 0.2)   # Exact result
    1.461 ± 0.046
    ```
Complex Measurements
--------------------

Here are a few examples about uncertainty propagation of complex-valued
measurements.


```@repl
using Measurements
u = complex(32.7 ± 1.1, -3.1 ± 0.2);
v = complex(7.6 ± 0.9, 53.2 ± 3.4);
2u + v
sqrt(u * v)
```

You can also verify the [Euler's
formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_formula)

```@repl
using Measurements
u = complex(32.7 ± 1.1, -3.1 ± 0.2);
cis(u)
cos(u) + sin(u)*im
```

Missing Measurements
--------------------

`Measurement` objects are poisoned by [`missing`
values](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/missing/) as expected:

```@repl
using Measurements
x = -34.62 ± 0.93
y = missing ± 1.5
x ^ 2 / y
```

Arbitrary Precision Calculations
--------------------------------

If you performed an exceptionally good experiment that gave you
extremely precise results (that is, with very low relative error), you
may want to use [arbitrary
precision](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/integers-and-floating-point-numbers/#Arbitrary-Precision-Arithmetic-1)
(or multiple precision) calculations, in order not to loose significance
of the experimental results. Luckily, Julia natively supports this type
of arithmetic and so `Measurements.jl` does. You only have to create
`Measurement` objects with nominal value and uncertainty of type
`BigFloat`.

!!! tip

    As explained in the [Julia
    documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/numbers/#BigFloats-and-BigInts-1),
    it is better to use `BigFloat("12.34")`, rather than `BigFloat(12.34)`. See examples below.

For example, you want to measure a quantity that is the product of two
observables $a$ and $b$, and the expected value of the product is
$12.00000007$. You measure $a = 3.00000001 \pm (1\times 10^{-17})$ and $b =
4.0000000100000001 \pm (1\times 10^{-17})$ and want to compute the standard
score of the product with [`stdscore`](@ref). Using the ability of
`Measurements.jl` to perform arbitrary precision calculations you discover that

```@repl
using Measurements
a = BigFloat("3.00000001") ± BigFloat("1e-17");
b = BigFloat("4.0000000100000001") ± BigFloat("1e-17");
stdscore(a * b, BigFloat("12.00000007"))
```

the measurement significantly differs from the expected value and you
make a great discovery. Instead, if you used double precision accuracy,
you would have wrongly found that your measurement is consistent with
the expected value:

```@repl
using Measurements
stdscore((3.00000001 ± 1e-17)*(4.0000000100000001 ± 1e-17), 12.00000007)
```

and you would have missed an important prize due to the use of an
incorrect arithmetic.

Of course, you can perform any mathematical operation supported in
`Measurements.jl` using arbitrary precision arithmetic:

```@repl
using Measurements
a = BigFloat("3.00000001") ± BigFloat("1e-17");
b = BigFloat("4.0000000100000001") ± BigFloat("1e-17");
hypot(a, b)
log(2a) ^ b
```

Operations with Arrays and Linear Algebra
-----------------------------------------

You can create arrays of `Measurement` objects and perform mathematical
operations on them in the most natural way possible:

```@repl
using Measurements
A = [1.03 ± 0.14, 2.88 ± 0.35, 5.46 ± 0.97]
B = [0.92 ± 0.11, 3.14 ± 0.42, 4.67 ± 0.58]
exp.(sqrt.(B)) .- log.(A)
@. cos(A) ^ 2 + sin(A) ^ 2
```

If you originally have separate arrays of values and uncertainties, you
can create an array of `Measurement` objects using `measurement` or `±`
with the [dot
syntax](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/functions/#man-vectorized-1)
for vectorizing functions:

```@repl
using Measurements, Statistics
C = measurement.([174.9, 253.8, 626.3], [12.2, 19.4, 38.5])
sum(C)
D = [549.4, 672.3, 528.5] .± [7.4, 9.6, 5.2]
mean(D)
```

!!! tip
    `prod` and `sum` (and `mean`, which relies on `sum`) functions work
    out-of-the-box with any iterable of `Measurement` objects, like arrays
    or tuples. However, these functions have faster methods (quadratic in
    the number of elements) when operating on an array of `Measurement` s
    than on a tuple (in this case the computational complexity is cubic in
    the number of elements), so you should use an array if performance is
    crucial for you, in particular for large collections of measurements.

Some [linear algebra](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/LinearAlgebra/)
functions work out-of-the-box, without defining specific methods for them. For
example, you can solve linear systems, do matrix multiplication and dot product
between vectors, find inverse, determinant, and trace of a matrix, do LU and QR
factorization, etc. Additional linear algebra methods (`eigvals`, `cholesky`, 
etc.) are provided by
[GenericLinearAlgebra.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLinearAlgebra/GenericLinearAlgebra.jl).

```@repl
using Measurements, LinearAlgebra
A = [(14 ± 0.1) (23 ± 0.2); (-12 ± 0.3) (24 ± 0.4)]
b = [(7 ± 0.5), (-13 ± 0.6)]
x = A \ b
A * x ≈ b
dot(x, b)
det(A)
tr(A)
A * inv(A) ≈ Matrix{eltype(A)}(I, size(A))
lu(A)
qr(A)
```

Derivative, Gradient and Uncertainty Components
-----------------------------------------------

In order to propagate the uncertainties, `Measurements.jl` keeps track of the
partial derivative of an expression with respect to all independent measurements
from which the expression comes. The package provides a convenient function,
[`Measurements.derivative`](@ref), that returns the partial derivative of an
expression with respect to independent measurements. Its vectorized version can
be used to compute the gradient of an expression with respect to multiple
independent measurements.

```@repl
using Measurements
x = 98.1 ± 12.7
y = 105.4 ± 25.6
z = 78.3 ± 14.1
Measurements.derivative(2x - 4y, x)
Measurements.derivative(2x - 4y, y)
Measurements.derivative.(log1p(x) + y^2 - cos(x/y), [x, y, z])
```

The last result shows that the expression does not depend on `z`.

!!! tip
    The vectorized version of `Measurements.derivative` is
    useful in order to discover which variable contributes most to the total
    uncertainty of a given expression, if you want to minimize it. This can
    be calculated as the [Hadamard (element-wise)
    product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadamard_product_%28matrices%29)
    between the gradient of the expression with respect to the set of
    variables and the vector of uncertainties of the same variables in the
    same order. For example:

    ```julia
    julia> w = y^(3//4)*log(y) + 3x - cos(y/x)
    447.0410543780643 ± 52.41813324207829

    julia> abs.(Measurements.derivative.(w, [x, y]) .* Measurements.uncertainty.([x, y]))
    2-element Array{Float64,1}:
     37.9777
     36.1297
    ```

    In this case, the `x` variable contributes most to the uncertainty of
    `w`. In addition, note that the [Euclidean
    norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_norm) of the Hadamard
    product above is exactly the total uncertainty of the expression:

    ```julia
    julia> vecnorm(Measurements.derivative.(w, [x, y]) .* Measurements.uncertainty.([x, y]))
    52.41813324207829
    ```

    The [`Measurements.uncertainty_components`](@ref) function
    simplifies calculation of all uncertainty components of a derived
    quantity:

    ```julia
    julia> Measurements.uncertainty_components(w)
    Dict{Tuple{Float64,Float64,Float64},Float64} with 2 entries:
      (98.1, 12.7, 0.303638)  => 37.9777
      (105.4, 25.6, 0.465695) => 36.1297

    julia> norm(collect(values(Measurements.uncertainty_components(w))))
    52.41813324207829
    ```

`stdscore` Function
-------------------

You can get the distance in number of standard deviations between a measurement
and its expected value (not a `Measurement`) using [`stdscore`](@ref):

```@repl
using Measurements
stdscore(1.3 ± 0.12, 1)
```

You can use the same function also to test the consistency of two measurements
by computing the standard score between their difference and zero. This is what
[`stdscore`](@ref) does when both arguments are `Measurement` objects:

```@repl
using Measurements
stdscore((4.7 ± 0.58) - (5 ± 0.01), 0)
stdscore(4.7 ± 0.58, 5 ± 0.01)
```

`weightedmean` Function
-----------------------

Calculate the weighted and arithmetic means of your set of measurements with
[`weightedmean`](@ref) and `mean` respectively:

```@repl
using Measurements, Statistics
weightedmean((3.1±0.32, 3.2±0.38, 3.5±0.61, 3.8±0.25))
mean((3.1±0.32, 3.2±0.38, 3.5±0.61, 3.8±0.25))
```

`Measurements.value` and `Measurements.uncertainty` Functions
-------------------------------------------------------------

Use [`Measurements.value`](@ref) and [`Measurements.uncertainty`](@ref) to get
the values and uncertainties of measurements. They work with real and complex
measurements, scalars or arrays:

```@repl
using Measurements
Measurements.value(94.5 ± 1.6)
Measurements.uncertainty(94.5 ± 1.6)
Measurements.value.([complex(87.3 ± 2.9, 64.3 ± 3.0), complex(55.1 ± 2.8, -19.1 ± 4.6)])
Measurements.uncertainty.([complex(87.3 ± 2.9, 64.3 ± 3.0), complex(55.1 ± 2.8, -19.1 ± 4.6)])
```

Calculating the Covariance and Correlation Matrices
---------------------------------------------------

Calculate the covariance and correlation matrices of multiple `Measurement`s
with the functions [`cov(::AbstractVector{<:Measurement})`](@ref) and
[`cor(::AbstractVector{<:Measurement})`](@ref):

```@repl
using Measurements

x = measurement(1.0, 0.1)
y = -2x + 10
z = -3x
cov([x, y, z])
cor([x, y, z])
```

Creating Correlated Measurements from their Nominal Values and a Covariance Matrix
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using [`Measurements.correlated_values`](@ref), you can correlate
the uncertainty of fit parameters given a covariance matrix from
the fitted results. An example using
[LsqFit.jl](https://julianlsolvers.github.io/LsqFit.jl/latest/):

```@repl
using Measurements, LsqFit

@. model(x, p) = p[1] + x * p[2]

xdata = range(0, stop=10, length=20)
ydata = model(xdata, [1.0 2.0]) .+ 0.01 .* randn.()
p0 = [0.5, 0.5]

fit = curve_fit(model, xdata, ydata, p0)

coeficients = Measurements.correlated_values(coef(fit), estimate_covar(fit))
f(x) = model(x, coeficients)
```

Interplay with Third-Party Packages
-----------------------------------

`Measurements.jl` works out-of-the-box with any function taking
arguments no more specific than `AbstractFloat`. This makes this library
particularly suitable for cooperating with well-designed third-party
packages in order to perform complicated calculations always accurately
taking care of uncertainties and their correlations, with no effort for
the developers nor users.

The following sections present a sample of packages that are known to
work with `Measurements.jl`, but many others will interplay with this
package as well as them.

### Numerical Integration with `QuadGK.jl`

The powerful integration routine `quadgk` from `QuadGK.jl` package is
smart enough to support out-of-the-box integrand functions that return
arbitrary types, including `Measurement`:

```@repl
using Measurements, QuadGK
a = 4.71 ± 0.01;
quadgk(x -> exp(x / a), 1, 7)[1]
```

`Measurements.jl` pushes the capabilities of `quadgk` further by
supporting also `Measurement` objects as endpoints:

```@repl
using Measurements, QuadGK
quadgk(cos, 1.19 ± 0.02, 8.37 ± 0.05)[1]
```

Compare this with the expected result:

```@repl
using Measurements, QuadGK
sin(8.37 ± 0.05) - sin(1.19 ± 0.02)
```

Also with `quadgk` correlation is properly taken into account:

```@repl
using Measurements, QuadGK
a = 6.42 ± 0.03
quadgk(sin, -a, a)
```

If instead the two endpoints have, by chance, the same nominal value and
uncertainty but are not correlated:

```@repl
using Measurements, QuadGK
quadgk(sin, -6.42 ± 0.03, 6.42 ± 0.03)
```

### Numerical and Automatic Differentiation

With [Calculus.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMath/Calculus.jl)
package it is possible to perform numerical differentiation using finite
differencing. You can pass in to the `Calculus.derivative` function both
functions returning `Measurement` objects and a `Measurement` as the
point in which to calculate the derivative.

```@repl
using Measurements, Calculus
a = -45.7 ± 1.6
b = 36.5 ± 6.0
Calculus.derivative(exp, a) ≈ exp(a)
Calculus.derivative(cos, b) ≈ -sin(b)
Calculus.derivative(t -> log(-t * b)^2, a) ≈ 2log(-a * b)/a
```

Other packages provide [automatic
differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation)
methods. Here is an example with
[AutoGrad.jl](https://github.com/denizyuret/AutoGrad.jl), just one of
the packages available:

```@repl
using Measurements, AutoGrad
a = -45.7 ± 1.6
b = 36.5 ± 6.0
grad(exp)(a) ≈ exp(a)
grad(cos)(b) ≈ -sin(b)
grad(t -> log(-t * b)^2)(a) ≈ 2log(-a * b)/a
```

However remember that you can always use [`Measurements.derivative`](@ref) to
compute the value (without uncertainty) of the derivative of a `Measurement`
object.

### Use with `Unitful.jl`

You can use `Measurements.jl` in combination with
[Unitful.jl](https://github.com/PainterQubits/Unitful.jl) in order to perform
calculations involving physical measurements, i.e.  numbers with uncertainty and
physical unit.  You only have to use the `Measurement` object as the value of
the `Quantity` object. Here are a few examples.

```@repl
using Measurements, Unitful
hypot((3 ± 1)*u"m", (4 ± 2)*u"m") # Pythagorean theorem
(50 ± 1)*u"Ω" * (13 ± 2.4)*1e-2*u"A" # Ohm's Law
2pi*sqrt((5.4 ± 0.3)*u"m" / ((9.81 ± 0.01)*u"m/s^2")) # Pendulum's period
```

Integration with `Plots.jl`
---------------------------

`Measurements.jl` provides plot recipes for the Julia graphic framework
[Plots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl). Arguments to `plot`
function that have `Measurement` type will be automatically represented
with errorbars.

```julia
julia> using Measurements, Plots

julia> plot(sin, [x ± 0.1 for x in 1:0.2:10], size = (1200, 800))
```
